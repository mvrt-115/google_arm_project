# TODO

## Arm / Arduino / Plotter
- [ ] Coordinate system
- [ ] Draw Lines and Arcs
- [ ] Communicate with Pi
- [ ] Get plotter up and running
- [ ] Try to make plotter mirror arm functionality

## Rasberry Pi / Google Stuff
- [ ] Get updated [example](https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/guides/service/python/extend/custom-actions?) to run
- [ ] Make `pushtotalk_Button_CustomTraits.py` compatable with latest version
- [ ] Update `ttt_Actions.json` to follow `Example_Action.json` format
- [ ] Update `ttt_Actions.json` to accept different responses and have different questions

  - Each `@devicehandler` serves as a method call when the action is triggered
  - Inside each method, use the TTTARM code to play the game
- [x] Update current `TTTArm.py` code to use lines and arcs system
- [ ] Attempt to replace current text to speech solution with better one
- [ ] Update `pushtotalk_Button_CustomTraits.py` to use updated TTT code
- [x] Think of a new game (Reverse Google QuickDraw)
- [x] Code proof of concept for RGQD
- [ ] Create custom traits for RGQD
- [ ] Code RGQD and intergrate into current system
- [ ] Everything [else](https://imgur.com/gallery/RadSf)
