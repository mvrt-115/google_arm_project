# TODO
## Arm / Arduino
- [X] Coordinate system
- [X] Draw Xs and Os
- [X] Communicate with Pi
- [X] Integrate code w/ coords and Serial comms.
- [ ] Test simplified drawing cycles
- [X] Create scalable table feature
- [ ] Test scalable table feature
- [X] Work with RPI group to standarize Serial comm syntax

## Rasberry Pi / Google Stuff
- [x] Get example to run
- [x] PoC of rPi to Arduino via serial
- [x] Trigger example with button
- [ ] Add LED that lights up when prompting
- [x] Write our own custom traits
- [ ] Figure out how to enable mutliple custom traits at once
- [ ] Integrate traits into code
  - Each `@devicehandler` serves as a method call when the trait is triggered
  - Inside each method, use the TTTARM code to play the game
- [ ] Convert current TTT code into a class so it can be used as library
  - The overall structure is on top of the TTTARM.py file
- [ ] Use created library/class to enable TTT in pushtotalk.py
- [ ] Everything [else](https://imgur.com/gallery/RadSf)

## Other
- [ ] Make enclosure for electronics
- [ ] Make entire thing "Google" worthy
