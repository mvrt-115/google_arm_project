# Google Project

## Introduction:
This project is a collaboration with Google. The devices being made use Google's Custom Actions feature to control robots that can play various games.

## Games:
- Tic Tac Toe
- Reverse Google Quick Draw

## Devices:
### Arm Controls/Setup:

### Plotter Controls/Setup:

### Raspberry Pi Commands:
- Start Virtual Enviroment: `source /env/bin/activate`
- Follow the Custom Actions page for everything else
- We are using the Assistant SERVICE, not Assistant library. **Make sure the documentation url says SERVICE**
- AFAIK there is no easy way to test on Windows or Mac
